/*
 				Question 2: Composition- Car and Engine System
 Implement a car system using Composition where Car contains Engine.
 Requirements:
	 • Engine class: horsepower, fuel consumption per km
	 • Car class: model name, contains one Engine object
	 • Engine cannot exist without Car
	 • When Car is destroyed, Engine is also destroyed
 Basic Calculations:
	 (a) Fuel needed for trip: Fuel = Distance × Consumption per km
	 (b) Trip cost: Cost = Fuel needed ×Price per liter
	 (c) Speed calculation: Speed = Distance
 Time
 	(d) Fuel efficiency: Efficiency =
 Implementation:
	 100
	 Consumption per 100km
	 • Create 2 different cars with different engines
	 • Calculate fuel cost for a 200km trip (fuel price = $1.50/liter)
	 • Compare which car is more fuel efficient
